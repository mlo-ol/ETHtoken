# ETH MyToken Project

This project implements a basic Ethereum token contract named "ETHProj" with the abbreviation "ETHP". The contract allows for the minting and burning of tokens, tracking the total supply and balances of each address.

## Description

The MyToken contract is a simple implementation of a token on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functionalities for minting new tokens and burning existing ones. The contract also keeps track of the total supply of tokens and the balance of each address. The project demonstrates basic principles of token management on a blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this contract, you need to have a development environment for Ethereum smart contracts. For this activity, I used Remix IDE.

### Executing program

1. Open Remix IDE.
2. Create a new file and paste the contract code.
3. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler version 0.8.18.
4. Deploy the contract to a test network.
